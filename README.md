## How do I deploy this container stack?

See [https://github.com/wetfish/production-manifests](https://github.com/wetfish/production-manifests)
for production deployment and full stack dev env info.

TODO: doesnt work with rootless docker/podman, need to build and launch as root.

For development, to run just this stack, do 
```bash
cp mariadb.env.example mariadb.env
# -> edit, change passwords and other info as needed
cp php.env.example php.env
# -> edit, change db info to match mariadb, other passwords as needed
# for the uploader & gallery features
chmod 777 ./upload; mkdir ./upload/thumbs; chmod -R 777 ./upload/thumbs

# in dev env, run npm install manually
cd wwwroot/src && npm install

docker compose \
  -f docker-compose.dev.yml \
  up -d \
  --build \
  --force-recreate

docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f
```

The service will be available at [http://127.0.0.1:2405](http://127.0.0.1:2405)

If you'd like, /etc/hosts wiki.wetfish.net.local to 127.0.0.1 and browse to that.
